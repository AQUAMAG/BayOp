>>> Notes <<<
On 6/21/2018, substrates and target cleaned ("sanded" with Scotchbrite, swabbed with methanol, blown dry with N2) and placed in chamber as on 6/20/2018.

On 6/25/2018, chamber pumped out with turbopump starting @ ~1400. At 1420, chamber pressure is 3.2E-6 Torr. Substrate heater and cooling water set as on 5/18/2017.

At 1430, laser pressure is 2971 mbar. For deposition, laser voltage set to 30 kV, and laser energy measured at laser exit (5Hz, avg 15 pulses, 147 mJ). Based on 3/1/2018 measurements, this will give a beam energy of (147 mJ)*(5.2/14.5)=52.7 mJ at the target.

At 1435 base pressure (gas line valve open) is 2.5E-6 Torr. O2 flow set as listed, and chamber pressure (read with Convectron gauge 1) adjusted by manually throttling the turbopump gate valve (adjusted periodically over course of deposition).

Starting position S of beam rastering mirror set to Z=25000, with vernier set to 5.0. Position/velocity pair values of mirror raster program set to: (1) S+3800, 60, (2) S, 60, (3) S-3800,60, (4) S, 60.

With substrate shutter closed, started target rotation and mirror rastering, and ablated target (starting at 1445) for 30 minutes to condition the target surface (i.e., to reach a steady state surface composition).

Heater started @ 1446. Heater temperature reached 690C @ 1508.

To begin film deposition, substrate rotation started (@ 1513), and substrate shutter opened (set to 300 deg). Started deposition @ 1515.

At end of deposition @ 1615, laser, heater, substrate rotation, target rotation, and mirror rastering turned off. Substrate shutter closed.

Beam energy measured again (137 mJ); value listed at right is average of initial and final beam energies. Laser pressure is now 2980 mbar. Average beam energy at target is about 50.9 mJ.

After cooling 37 min (to 75 C) at listed O2 pressure, O2 turned off.

New substrates cleaned as before. Vented chamber with N2, and removed samples and target. New substrates loaded. Target pictures taken. Target cleaned as on 8/11/16 and loaded. Chamber pumped out with turbopump @ 1727. Pump valves closed and pumps turned off. Will repeat above deposition procedures, but at a different substrate temperature.
